## About webpack

Webpack is an open source JavaScript module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. Itâ€™s a module bundler primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets like HTML, CSS, even images if the corresponding plugins are included.
